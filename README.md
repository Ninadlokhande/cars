Project Overview
This data science project aims to predict the selling price of used cars based on their various features. The project follows a complete data science pipeline, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. The final model is a Random Forest Regressor capable of estimating the value of a car with high accuracy.

This project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (car_price_prediction.ipynb).

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is cars.csv. It contains information about used cars listed for sale.

Dataset Columns:

Car_Name: The name/model of the car.

Year: The year the car was manufactured.

Selling_Price: The price the car was sold for (in lakhs INR). This is the target variable.

Present_Price: The current showroom price of a new car of the same model (in lakhs INR).

Kms_Driven: The total kilometers the car has been driven.

Fuel_Type: The type of fuel the car uses (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, CNG).

Seller_Type: The type of seller (e.g., Dealer, Owner).

Transmission: The transmission type of the car (e.g., Manual, Automatic).

Owner: The number of previous owners the car has had.

Project Workflow
The project is structured into the following key stages:

Data Loading and Inspection: The cars.csv dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame. An initial inspection is performed to understand its structure, data types, and basic statistics.

Data Cleaning: The dataset is checked for missing values and duplicates to ensure data quality.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations like histograms, count plots, and a correlation heatmap are used to uncover patterns, distributions, and relationships between features. A key finding was the strong positive correlation between Present_Price and Selling_Price.

Feature Engineering: A new feature, Car_Age, is created from the Year column to provide a more intuitive measure for the model. Categorical features (Fuel_Type, Seller_Type, Transmission) are converted into numerical format using one-hot encoding.

Model Building: The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. A Random Forest Regressor model is trained on the training data.

Model Evaluation: The trained model's performance is evaluated on the unseen test data using key regression metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R-squared (R 
2
 ) Score

Installation and Setup
To run this project, you need to have Python installed. You can set up the environment and install the required libraries using pip.

Bash

# Clone the repository (if applicable) or download the files
# git clone <repository-url>
# cd <repository-directory>

# Install the required Python libraries
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyterlab
How to Run
Ensure you have all the required libraries installed (see Installation and Setup).

Make sure the dataset cars.csv is in the same directory as the notebook.

Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

Bash

jupyter notebook
or

Bash

jupyter lab
Open the notebook file (car_price_prediction.ipynb).

Run the cells sequentially from top to bottom.

Results
The Random Forest Regressor model performed exceptionally well on the test data.

R-squared (R 
2
 ) Score: The model typically achieves an R 
2
  score greater than 0.90, indicating that it can explain over 90% of the variance in the car selling prices.

Key Insight: The Present_Price of a car is the most significant predictor of its Selling_Price. Car_Age and Kms_Driven also contribute negatively to the price, as expected.

Future Work
Potential improvements and future analysis could include:

Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find the optimal parameters for the Random Forest model.

Trying Different Models: Experiment with other advanced regression models like Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, or CatBoost to potentially improve accuracy.

Advanced Feature Engineering: Utilize the Car_Name column by extracting the brand name (e.g., 'Maruti', 'Hyundai') as a separate feature.
